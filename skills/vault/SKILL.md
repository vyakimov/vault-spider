description: >-
  Search, answer from, and maintain the user's Obsidian vault using the
  vault-spider CLI (retrieval / synthesis / lint / enrich / safe note mutations).
  Use when the user asks what they know or wrote about something, or wants
  notes found, captured, enriched, filed, or vault health checked.

# vault

Thin orchestration over one JSON CLI (plus the official `obsidian` CLI for a few read-only
extras). This file encodes **when to use which command** — it holds no ranking, YAML, or path
logic (that lives in the CLI). Every command prints one JSON envelope; **check the `"ok"` field,
never exit codes.**

## Tools & preconditions

- **`vault-spider`** — invoke the stable wrapper at `<repo>/bin/vault-spider ...` (or
  `./bin/vault-spider ...` from the repo); do not construct `uv run` calls directly. The wrapper
  locates the project and preserves argv, JSON output, and exit status. Config comes from
  `config.yaml` (vault root, skip dirs, distilled dir, Obsidian connection facts — see
  `config.yaml.example`). Vault resolution is explicit flags, then config, then the active
  Obsidian vault, so `--root` can be omitted everywhere.
  - *Query commands* (`retrieve`, `synthesize`, `enrich`, `stats`, `sync`, `lint`) need `.env`
    (OpenRouter) except `stats` and `lint`. `vault-spider stats` needs no API key — it is the cheap
    "is the index alive?" check.
  - *Mutation commands* (`create-note`, `read-note`, `edit-note`, `merge-frontmatter`, `add-links`,
    `insert-related`, `move-note`, `rename-note`, `open-note`) **need the Obsidian app running**;
    they go through the official Obsidian CLI so links update and plugins fire.
- **`obsidian`** — the official CLI; read-only use here (`backlinks`, `unresolved`, `tags`).
  Errors print `Error:` text with exit 0.

`vault-spider schema` (version 2) describes every command, contract, and error type in one document;
full flags are in [references/commands.md](references/commands.md).

## Decision rules

**Find notes vs. answer a question**
- User wants to *find or open* notes → `vault-spider retrieve`; present the candidate list.
- User asks a *question* → `vault-spider synthesize`; present the answer with citations.

**Retrieval depth**
- Proper nouns, note titles, "where did I write X" → `retrieve --mode fast --granularity document`.
- Conceptual / multi-note, "what do I know about X" → `--mode thorough --granularity mixed`
  (`mixed` = section pool capped at 3 sections per note; it never returns whole documents).
- Escalate fast → thorough when fast results look off-topic (no title/keyword overlap).

**Scoped queries → filters, not query stuffing** — when the user scopes by place, kind, tag, or
time ("my journal notes from June", "notes tagged #recipe"), keep the query semantic and pass the
scope as filters — they work on both `retrieve` and `synthesize`: `--folder` (prefix match),
`--tag` (repeatable, all must match), `--type`, `--since`/`--until` (ISO dates, compared against
`updated`/`date` — undated notes drop out), `--must-include` (repeatable, exact term required in
the text). An empty scope fails with `not_found: No documents match the required filters` — retry
without filters and tell the user the scope matched nothing.

**Abstention** — if `synthesize` returns `abstained: true`, tell the user what's missing and offer
a broader retrieve. Never pad an abstained answer. An answer that cites nothing is already treated
as an abstention by the CLI.

**Warnings** — read `warnings[]` on every synthesis. Surface "N sentence(s) lack citations" to the
user with the answer; treat it as a reason not to offer `--save`.

**Missing notes are usually by design** — a note the user knows exists but never surfaces is most
likely excluded on purpose: `#secret`/`#ignore` tags, a skipped folder (`vault.skip_dirs`), a
hidden directory, or an Excalidraw drawing. Check `config.yaml` before suspecting the index. A
recently created note just needs `vault-spider sync`.

**Saving distilled notes** — offer `synthesize --save` only when the answer is confidence
high/medium AND cites ≥2 notes AND has no uncited-sentence warnings AND the question is reusable
(research-y, not operational). Ask first; never save silently. The CLI independently refuses to
save abstained, low-confidence, or citation-less answers and never overwrites — on `saved: false`,
relay its warning instead of retrying. After saving, remind that `vault-spider sync` indexes it.

**Capture & enrichment** — new material → capture into `Inbox/`, then offer enrichment. Both are
multi-step and have a fixed apply order and frontmatter policy: follow
[references/capture-and-enrichment.md](references/capture-and-enrichment.md).

**Maintenance** — "vault health / broken links / cleanup" → `vault-spider lint`; summarize counts,
then lead with the ranked checks: `dangling_targets` (the best notes to write next, by how many
notes want them) and `empty_notes` (the most valuable stubs to fill, by inbound links). Fixes are
the user's decisions; the only built-in fixers are `lint --fix` (adds *missing* `id`/`created`/
`updated`, never edits a value) and `lint --fix-timestamps` (naive → offset-aware) — both opt-in.

**Sync hygiene** — sync is incremental and only re-embeds changed content, so it is cheap to run
after any batch of captures or edits (remind the user, or run it if they agree). When unsure what
changed, `sync --dry-run` previews adds/updates/deletes without touching the index.

## Mutations — hard rules

- Every mutation (`create-note`, `edit-note`, `merge-frontmatter`, `add-links`, `insert-related`,
  `move-note`, `rename-note`): run with `--dry-run` first, show the result, then apply on
  confirmation.
- For body changes, use `edit-note` with exact `old_text` → `new_text` operations; never rewrite
  the vault file directly. Its dry run returns a rendered unified `result.diff` and
  `result.expected_sha256`. Apply the identical edits with `--expected-sha256 <that value>`.
  Never reuse a guard after `contract_violation`; read the note again and repeat the dry run.
  If `old_text` repeats, set the intended 1-based `occurrence`. Use `merge-frontmatter` for
  metadata — `edit-note` only touches frontmatter when `obsidian.manage_updated: true`, in which
  case `result.diff` includes the exact `updated` value it proposes/writes.
- If a mutation fails with `error.type: obsidian_not_running`, tell the user to open Obsidian;
  do not retry blindly.
- Never construct a frontmatter patch containing `id`, `created`, `updated`, or `tags`.
- Create notes with `create-note --auto-id` so the CLI mints `id`/`created`/`updated`; never
  mint those values by hand.
- Move/rename only with explicit user approval of the exact destination.
- Anything reported as `ambiguous_target`, `config_mismatch`, or `contract_violation` → surface
  verbatim; do not work around it. `config_mismatch` means config and Obsidian disagree about the
  vault in use, so tell the user to fix config.

## Output conventions

- Retrieval hits: one `title — path` line each with the one-line `why`.
- Synthesis answers: render citations as `[[title]]` references the user can open; append any
  `warnings[]` verbatim.
- Errors: quote `error.type: message` from the envelope rather than paraphrasing.

This repository is **Vault RAG**, a retrieval **and mutation** system for an Obsidian vault of
Markdown notes — one CLI for querying and modifying the vault.

The vault itself is never committed. Its location, and everything else installation-specific,
lives in `config.yaml` (gitignored; copy `config.yaml.example`). Secrets live in `.env`.

## Project Overview

The project indexes `.md` files from the vault into ChromaDB, builds BM25 indexes, and exposes
hybrid retrieval and answer synthesis with stable JSON contracts. It also carries the vault's
write path: contract-enforcing note mutations executed through the running Obsidian app (the
former standalone `obsctl` tool, merged into this CLI). It is organized as the `vault_rag`
Python package with a JSON-only CLI (`vault-rag`) plus a Streamlit UI.

The read path (indexing, retrieval, lint) works on vault files directly; the write path goes
through the official Obsidian CLI so wikilinks update on move/rename, unknown frontmatter keys
survive patches, and vault plugins fire. Keep that boundary: **never write vault files directly
from mutation code.**

One note is indexed as **one `document`-granularity entry plus N `section` entries** (section
splitting is deterministic, heading-based). Both live in a single Chroma collection, distinguished
by the `granularity` metadata field.

## Key Commands

- `uv run vault-rag schema`
  - Prints the machine-readable command + contract schema (`version: 1`).
- `uv run vault-rag sync [--root <dir>] [--reset]`  (`--root` defaults to `vault.root` in `config.yaml`)
  - Incremental sync: adds new notes, re-embeds changed or moved notes, deletes removed notes.
    Notes sharing a duplicate frontmatter `id` are skipped after the first and reported in
    the result's `warnings`.
  - Failure-safe ordering: old entries are deleted only after all new embeddings have been
    computed and validated, so a provider failure mid-sync leaves the existing index usable.
  - `--reset` rebuilds the collection from scratch (needed once after an entry-shape change).
- `uv run vault-rag stats` — index statistics (no API key needed).
- `uv run vault-rag retrieve --query "..." [--mode fast|thorough] [--granularity document|section|mixed] [-n 10]`
  - Returns the retrieval output contract (candidates with score breakdown). Defaults: `fast`, `document`.
    `mixed` searches the section pool with a 3-sections-per-note cap (it does not mix in document entries).
  - `fast` skips reranking; `thorough` reranks the top candidates.
- `uv run vault-rag synthesize --query "..." [--mode thorough] [--granularity mixed] [--retrieval file.json] [--n-context 8] [--save --root <dir> [--save-dir Distilled]]`
  - Retrieves (defaults `thorough`/`mixed`) then synthesizes a cited answer. `--retrieval` reuses a
    prior `retrieve` envelope/contract and skips retrieval. Abstains when the notes lack the answer.
  - `--save` persists a high-quality answer as a create-only **distilled note** (`type: distilled`)
    under `<root>/<save-dir>`. `--save-dir` must be a vault-relative path resolving inside the
    root. Skips (with a warning) when the answer abstained, is low-confidence, is empty, has no
    citations, or the target exists. Distilled notes are regenerable pointers to their
    sources — raw notes always win on conflict. Run `vault-rag sync` afterward to index it.
- `uv run vault-rag lint --root <dir> [--format json|text] [--fix] [--fix-timestamps]`
  - Read-only corpus health report (no LLM or index needed): missing frontmatter fields,
    invalid/naive timestamps, duplicate ids, duplicate titles, broken wikilinks, `dangling_targets`
    (unresolved link targets ranked by how many notes want them — the best next notes to write),
    `empty_notes` (stubs, ranked by inbound links), `conflict_copies` (`Note 1.md` beside
    `Note.md`), orphans, stale distilled notes.
  - Link resolution follows Obsidian: frontmatter links (`parents: "[[Daily Notes]]"`) count as
    real edges, `aliases` resolve, and `[[diagram.png]]` resolves to an attachment rather than
    being reported broken.
  - `--fix` writes only *missing* `id`/`created`/`updated` frontmatter (never edits a value).
    `--fix-timestamps` additionally rewrites *naive* `created`/`updated`/`date` as offset-aware —
    a naive timestamp is local wall-clock time, so the local offset is attached with historical
    DST; unparseable values are skipped, never guessed.
- `uv run vault-rag enrich --root <dir> (--note <path> | --stdin) [--intent ...] [--source-type transcript|web|pdf|manual] [--source-url ...] [--title ...]`
  - App-agnostic **enrichment planner**: retrieves a note's neighborhood and proposes a title,
    frontmatter patch (`type`/`aliases`/`source_type`/`source_url` only), inline links, related
    candidates, and placement — as JSON. It **never mutates** files or the index; apply a plan
    with the mutation commands below. Only links to retrieved neighbors are proposed; the LLM
    output is validated in code (confidence gating, anchor resolution, existing-type/link guards,
    `source_type` restricted to the four allowed values, unsafe titles and non-numeric
    confidences dropped with warnings). `--note` must be a vault-relative `.md` path resolving
    inside `--root`.
- **Note mutations** — `create-note`, `read-note`, `merge-frontmatter`, `add-links`,
  `insert-related`, `move-note`, `rename-note`, `open-note` (all `uv run vault-rag <command>`).
  - Executed through the official Obsidian CLI; **the Obsidian app must be running** (macOS only).
    Connection facts come from `config.yaml` (`obsidian.binary`/`obsidian.vault`, overridable per
    command with `--binary`/`--vault`).
  - Every mutating command accepts `--dry-run`: it computes and returns exactly what would change
    with `meta.dry_run: true` and makes no backend mutation calls.
  - `create-note --auto-id` mints `id` (ULID) and `created`/`updated` (the same timestamp,
    formatted per `timestamps.policy`) for whichever of the three are missing from
    `--frontmatter`; explicit values always win. Templater does not fire on CLI-created notes,
    so prefer `--auto-id` over minting these fields by hand.
  - Contract enforcement: `id`/`created` are immutable once set (`contract_violation`); empty
    optional fields (`""`, `[]`, `null`) are refused; creates/moves/renames fail with
    `already_exists` rather than overwrite; `add-links`/`insert-related`/alias patches are
    idempotent. `updated` is left to the modified-date plugin unless
    `obsidian.manage_updated: true`. Timestamps are written untyped, following
    `timestamps.policy`.
  - Path arguments (`--path`, `--to`, `--name`) are validated as clean vault-relative POSIX
    paths — absolute paths, backslashes and `.`/`..` segments are `invalid_arguments` before the
    backend is invoked; link targets must be plain note names (no `[[`/`]]`/newlines). Every
    envelope carries `meta.backend: "obsidian-cli"`.
- `uv run streamlit run scripts/streamlit_app.py`
  - Streamlit UI: Retrieve (mode + granularity selectors), Synthesize, Notes browser.
- `uv run pytest`
  - Network-free test suite (uses a fake provider; no API key required).

All CLI output is a single JSON envelope on stdout: `{"ok": bool, "action", "result", "meta"}` on
success, `{"ok": false, "action", "error": {"type", "message", "details"}}` on failure (exit 1).
This holds for *every* failure: argparse errors (bad flags, missing/unknown commands) are
converted to `invalid_arguments` envelopes rather than printing usage text.
Error types: `invalid_arguments`, `index_empty`, `provider_error`, `not_found`, `internal_error`,
`obsidian_not_running`, `backend_error`, `already_exists`, `ambiguous_target`,
`contract_violation`. The schema (`vault-rag schema`) is `version: 2` — the version where the
mutation commands were merged in. In the schema, `mutates_state` is always a boolean ("can this
command write?"); the optional `mutates` string qualifies what and when.

## Environment

Required environment variables (loaded from `.env` via `python-dotenv`):

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
- `OPENROUTER_CHAT_MODEL`

Optional:

- `OPENROUTER_RERANK_MODEL` (enables reranking in `thorough` mode)
- `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`
- `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER`
- `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE`

Install dependencies with `uv sync`.

## Architecture

The `vault_rag` package is layered:

1. `vault_rag/corpus/`
   - `frontmatter.py` — YAML frontmatter split, tag normalization, datetime coercion.
   - `identity.py` — note id resolution (frontmatter `id`/ULID, else path hash).
   - `loader.py` — `load_notes(root)` → `Note` dataclasses (skips `#ignore`/`#secret` in the
     body or frontmatter `tags`, non-UTF-8 files, `.trash/`, `.obsidian/`, `Templates/`, every
     hidden directory — Obsidian never indexes dot-folders like `.git` — and
     Excalidraw drawings — `*.excalidraw.md` / `excalidraw-plugin` frontmatter — whose bodies are
     compressed drawing data rather than prose).
   - `chunker.py` — deterministic `split_sections` plus `document_text` / `section_text`.

2. `vault_rag/index/`
   - `store.py` — `IndexStore` with `sync(root, reset)`; maintains the Chroma collection and two
     in-memory BM25 indexes (document + section), diffing by `note_id` + `content_hash`.
   - `reader.py` — read-only Chroma access for the Notes UI.

3. `vault_rag/retrieval/`
   - `fusion.py` — pure RRF / z-score-sigmoid / min-max fusion.
   - `searcher.py` — `Searcher.hybrid_search` (embeddings + BM25 + fusion + optional rerank +
     recency); `fast`/`thorough` modes, `document`/`section`/`mixed` granularity.
   - `evidence.py` — builds the retrieval output contract (candidate objects + deterministic `why`).

4. `vault_rag/synthesis/`
   - `answer.py` — `synthesize()` turns a retrieval contract into a cited answer with abstention;
     robust JSON parsing / truncation repair. Malformed model output fails closed: a non-boolean
     `abstained` or non-string `answer` is treated as an abstention, never presented as grounded.

5. `vault_rag/compounding/`
   - `distill.py` — `save_distilled_note()` for `synthesize --save`.
   - `lint.py` — `lint_vault()` read-only health checks.
   `vault_rag/enrich/planner.py` — `plan()` enrichment planner (read-only; proposes, never mutates).

6. `vault_rag/obsidian/`
   - `backend.py` — invocation layer for the official Obsidian CLI: binary discovery, vault
     targeting, noise stripping, error mapping (`obsidian_not_running`, `not_found`, ...).
   - `notes.py` — the mutation commands: dry-run, no-op detection, collision safety, ambiguity
     rejection, idempotent link/alias merging, `id`/`created` immutability. Uses its own minimal
     untyped frontmatter parser on purpose (the YAML-typed `corpus/frontmatter.py` would not
     round-trip values faithfully).

7. `vault_rag/llm/openrouter.py` — embeddings, rerank, and chat via OpenRouter. Responses are
   strictly validated (index coverage, duplicate detection, dimensions, finite values); anything
   malformed raises `OpenRouterError` (`provider_error`) instead of misaligning the index.

8. `vault_rag/cli.py` + `vault_rag/envelope.py` — the JSON CLI, envelope helpers, and `CliError`.

9. `scripts/streamlit_*.py` — Streamlit pages that import from `vault_rag`.

`tools/backfill.py` — standalone one-time migration that adds `id`/`created`/`updated`
frontmatter to existing notes (dry-run by default; `--apply` to write; never touches bodies).
`uv run tools/backfill.py --root <dir> [--apply] [--report <path>]`. The timestamp policy comes
from `config.yaml` (`timestamps.policy`: `offset_local` or `utc_z`).

## Paths & Persistence

All of these are configurable in `config.yaml`; the values below are the defaults.

- ChromaDB directory: `./chroma_db/` (`index.chroma_path`)
- Note source: none by default — set `vault.root`, or pass `--root`
- Skipped folders: `.trash`, `.obsidian`, `Templates` (`vault.skip_dirs`), all hidden
  directories, plus Excalidraw drawings
- Never-indexed tags: `#ignore`, `#secret` (`vault.ignore_tags`)
- Obsidian mutation backend: binary auto-discovered, app's active vault,
  `manage_updated: false` (`obsidian.binary` / `obsidian.vault` / `obsidian.manage_updated`)
- Streamlit entrypoint: `scripts/streamlit_app.py`

## Development Notes

- Intra-package imports are absolute (`from vault_rag.corpus import loader`); no import fallbacks.
- `vault_rag/utils.py::validate_vault_relative_path` is the single gate for user-supplied vault
  paths (mutation `--path`/`--to`, `--save-dir`, `enrich --note`) — route any new path argument
  through it rather than validating ad hoc.
- Metadata stored per entry: `note_id`, `granularity`, `title`, `path`, `folder`, `tags`, `date`,
  `created`, `updated`, `note_type`, `content_hash`, `heading`, `line_start`, `line_end`, `source`.
- Retrieval/synthesis JSON contracts are stable; downstream tooling depends on them (see
  `vault-rag schema`).
- The LLM relevance judge was removed; abstention now lives in synthesis.
